# data-day-tx-2018

This is the talk given by Graham Ganssle and Steve Purves at [Data Day Texas](http://datadaytexas.com/) 2018. This talk was given in conjunction with Lynn Pausic and Chris LaCava's talk about how human bias is preserved in machine learning systems.

## The Aim
We show how biased training data biases results of model outputs by assessing the qualification of loan applicants based on US Census data. We train our model on a dense, varied dataset and quantify the difference in apparent loan-worthiness with respect to applicant gender.

**Are female loan applicants automatically screened out of credit applications by biased computer models?**

## Methods
We use a graph convolutional network to predict a node property (credit worthiness) from other node properties and edge connections to other credit applicants.

## Data
The data used in this experiment is extracted from the 1994 US Census data. It is the commonly referenced Census-Income dataset, AKA the "Adult" dataset. We got it from the UCI ML Repo, [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
